# Cat Shelter Workshop

Cat Shelter is a simple Node.js web application created for the JS Back-End course workshop.

The application works as a small cat catalog for a shelter. It uses HTML, CSS, Node.js routing, file system operations, and JSON files as a simple database.

## Features

* List all cats from a JSON database
* Add a new cat breed
* Add a new cat with name, description, image, and breed
* Upload cat images
* Edit existing cat information
* Shelter a cat / remove it from the catalog
* Search cats by name, breed, or description
* Serve static files such as CSS and images

## Technologies

* Node.js
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JSON file storage
* Formidable for file uploads

## Covered Workshop Topics

This project covers the main topics from the JS Back-End workshop:

- Introduction to Node.js: the application uses a custom Node.js HTTP server.
- Modules: the code is split into separate handler modules.
- Request and Response Wrapper: the project works directly with req and res objects.
- Node.js Web Server Streams: form data is handled through request events and file uploads.
- Streams: file upload handling is implemented with Formidable.
- Pub/Sub Pattern: the project uses Node.js event-based request handling.
- Events: request body parsing uses data and end events.
- FS Module: HTML views, JSON data, and uploaded files are handled through the file system.
- Debugging: the project was tested through browser checks, route checks, JSON validation, and Git checkpoints.

## Development Steps

1. Initialized the Node.js project with `npm init`.
2. Created the project folder structure.
3. Added the provided workshop resources and views.
4. Created a basic Node.js HTTP server.
5. Loaded the Home page from an HTML file.
6. Added a static files handler for CSS and images.
7. Added routes for Add Breed and Add Cat pages.
8. Implemented Add Breed functionality and saved breeds in `breeds.json`.
9. Implemented Add Cat functionality with image upload and saved cats in `cats.json`.
10. Rendered the Home page dynamically from the JSON database.
11. Implemented Edit Cat functionality.
12. Implemented Shelter the Cat functionality.
13. Implemented Search functionality.
14. Polished the page layout, forms, and cat cards.
15. Prepared the project for GitHub with commits and README documentation.

## How to Run

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

Open the application:

```txt
http://localhost:3001
```

## Notes

This project uses JSON files as a simple database:

* `data/cats.json`
* `data/breeds.json`

Uploaded images are saved in:

```txt
content/images/
```

The project was developed step by step as part of the JS Back-End workshop.
